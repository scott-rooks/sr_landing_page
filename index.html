                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I've lived in Roswell, Georgia with my wife and four children for almost 25 years. My journey into tech started in the MSCE program. Then in 2008 I started a small food business with my wife Joanne. I began to blog and write online; I was fascinated with the internet; I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific dreams.</p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I learned how to code and actually built my first website. Then learned all about html5 and css3, which opened a new and passionate world in my work. Now I've made a full commitment to front-end development, where I can use my organizational and small business skills, while writing clean, elegant and responsive code for other small businesses.</p>

                        <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

                        <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.</p>
